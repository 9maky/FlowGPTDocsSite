## Basic Usage

### NOTE

This section will briefly introduce prompt engineering. If you are already familiar with how to use products such as ChatGPT, you can skip this chapter.

### If you are new to ChatGPT

Here is a brief overview of how to use ChatGPT:

1. **Log in to ChatGPT.**
2. **Enter a question or command in the input box.**
3. **AI will return the corresponding content according to your instructions.**

In the following chapters, I will introduce more detailed usage and skills.

### Multiple rounds of conversation

Unlike some other AI products, ChatGPT supports multiple rounds of conversation. For example, if you ask "What is the capital of China?", ChatGPT will answer "Beijing". You can then ask "How many people live in Beijing?" without repeating the word "Beijing" in your question. ChatGPT will know that you are referring to the city of Beijing.

I hope this brief overview has been helpful. In the following chapters, I will introduce more detailed usage and skills.
