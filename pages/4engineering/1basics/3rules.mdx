# How to Write Better Prompts for ChatGPT

## Tips and Recommendations

When talking to ChatGPT, or when using and designing prompts, there are a few principles and recommendations that can help you write better prompts. Keeping these principles in mind will help you get better results from ChatGPT.

### Use the Latest Model

If you are using ChatGPT directly, such as through the ChatGPT website, you don't need to worry about this principle. However, if you are using ChatGPT through an API or other third-party service, it is recommended that you use the latest model available. The latest models are typically more powerful and can generate better results.

### Include Complete Information in the Prompt

The more information you include in the prompt, the better results you will get from ChatGPT. For example, if you want ChatGPT to write a poem about OpenAI, you should include information about OpenAI, such as its mission, its products, and its founders. The more information you include, the better ChatGPT will be able to understand what you want and generate a more accurate and relevant response.

### Keep Prompts Concise and Easy to Understand

It is best to keep prompts concise and easy to understand. This will help ChatGPT to understand what you want and generate a more accurate and relevant response. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that ChatGPT may not understand.

### Use Correct Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation

It is important to use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation in your prompts. This will help ChatGPT to understand what you want and generate a more accurate and relevant response.

### Be Patient

ChatGPT is still under development, and it may not always generate the results you want. If you are not satisfied with the results you get, try rephrasing the prompt or providing more information. With a little patience, you will be able to learn how to write prompts that get the best results from ChatGPT.

## Examples of Good and Bad Prompts

Here are some examples of good and bad prompts:

**Good Prompt:**

> Write a short poem about OpenAI, focusing on the recent DALL-E product launch.

This prompt is clear, concise, and easy to understand. It provides ChatGPT with all the information it needs to generate a poem about OpenAI.

**Bad Prompt:**

> Write a poem about OpenAI.

This prompt is vague and ambiguous. It does not provide ChatGPT with enough information to generate a poem about OpenAI.

I hope this helps!
