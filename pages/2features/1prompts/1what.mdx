## What are prompts?

A prompt is an instruction that is given to an AI model, such as ChatGPT, to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

Prompts can be as simple as a single word or phrase, or they can be more complex, such as a paragraph of text. The complexity of the prompt will depend on the task that you want the AI model to perform.

Here are some examples of prompts:

- **Generate text:**
  - "Write a poem about a cat."

  - "Translate this sentence from English to Spanish."

- **Answer questions in an informative way:**
  - "What is the capital of France?"
