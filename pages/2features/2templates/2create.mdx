- **Use examples.** If you can, it is helpful to provide examples of the type of content that you are looking for. For example, if you are creating a template for generating a blog post, you could provide examples of blog posts that you like. You can say that ChatGPT should bold important things using `**`, make title or subtitle using `#` and `#`, etc.
- **Use tags.** Tags are a great way to categorize your templates and make them easier to find. When creating a template, you can add tags to the template.
